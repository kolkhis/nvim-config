# Neovim Config

These are my personal Neovim configuration files.  

Refactored to work with Neovim v0.12.0. 
Significantly reduced the number of plugins used. Uses the builtin 
omnicompletion (`^X^O`), as well as the new native package manager (`vim.pack`).     

For list of plugins, see [pack.lua](./lua/kolkhis/pack.lua).
